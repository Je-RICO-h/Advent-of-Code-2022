# Advent-of-Code-2022
## My journey on the Exciting Advent of Code 2022
It's diverse a little bit, because i know multiple programming languages and i wanted to try myself in all.
I try my best to write the best, algorithmically most simple and effective programs, but there will be one or two ugly one, sorry for that.

## Languages you will see here (Not every puzzle is equally distributed, depends on my mood)
  - Java
  - C#
  - Python
  
  # Have fun, and Merry Christmas!
